## Summary

Describe the strategic outcome, user/developer value, and why this epic exists.

## Product Thesis

Explain the product belief this epic validates and the trust or capability it should create.

## Non-goals

- This epic does not:

## Architecture Invariants

- Existing architecture boundaries, quality gates, security posture, evidence semantics, and deterministic verification must not be weakened.
- Productive model calls must remain behind the Model Gateway.
- Workflow authority must remain explicit and documented.

## Target Outcome

1. Outcome 1.
2. Outcome 2.
3. Outcome 3.

## Child Issues

Child issues will be linked after creation.

## Required Implementation Order

1. First child issue.
2. Second child issue.
3. Final verification child issue.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All child issues are closed with acceptance criteria and expected verification updated.
- [ ] Required GitHub checks are green on implementation PRs.
- [ ] Final closure evidence is recorded in the epic or final child issue.
- [ ] Known limitations and follow-ups are documented.

## Agent Execution Mode

- [ ] Single-agent
- [ ] Agent team
- [ ] Audit-only
- [ ] Refactor-only
- [ ] Feature delivery
- [ ] Architecture / governance coordination
- [ ] Audit/verification-heavy

This epic is a planning and coordination container. Do not implement the full epic directly; execute the linked child issues in order.

## Agent Routing Hints

- Lead agent: `coordinator`.
- Required planning agents: `architect | explorer | security-reviewer | performance-engineer | docs-editor`.
- Delivery agents per child issue: selected from `implementor | developer | test-engineer | ui-engineer | a11y-auditor | verifier | pr-reviewer | pr-shepherd`.
- Write ownership: assigned per child issue only; no parallel write agents may own overlapping files.
- PR lifecycle owner: `pr-shepherd` waits for GitHub checks, resolves findings, and confirms formal issue completion before merge.

## Expected Verification

- [ ] Each child issue defines its own relevant verification gates.
- [ ] Required GitHub check: `ci` on every implementation PR.
- [ ] Security review when trust boundaries, model access, execution, patch application, generated artifacts, or validation guardrails change.
- [ ] Final regression evidence captured in the final child issue.

## Review Settlement and Formal Issue Completion

- [ ] Implementation PRs wait for required GitHub checks before merge.
- [ ] All actionable review findings are fixed or explicitly dispositioned before merge.
- [ ] Child issue Acceptance Criteria and Expected Verification checkboxes are updated only when evidence exists.
- [ ] The epic remains open until all child issues are closed and final closure evidence is recorded.

## Stop Conditions

- [ ] Stop if the implementation would expand beyond this epic's stated scope.
- [ ] Stop if required acceptance criteria are missing, contradictory, or no longer match the linked child issues.
- [ ] Stop if the work requires secrets, customer data, private runtime logs, or token-bearing artifacts.
- [ ] Stop if two parallel agents would need to edit the same file scope.
- [ ] Stop if the change would weaken architecture boundaries, quality gates, security posture, evidence semantics, deterministic verification, or required `ci` guarantees.
- [ ] Stop after three CI or review-finding repair attempts with different root causes and report the blocker.

## Language and Professional Standard

- All issue work, PR descriptions, code comments, configuration properties, schema fields, README updates, Markdown files, and GitHub comments must be written in professional English.
- Use accurate enterprise product terminology; when limitations exist, state them precisely without prototype-only, placeholder, fake, or informal framing.
- Build production-ready, state-of-the-art solutions while keeping implementation simple, maintainable, and focused on the issue scope.
- Be creative and innovative where it improves product quality, but avoid unnecessary special cases, speculative abstractions, and process overhead.
